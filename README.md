* The Human Pangenome Reference Consortium produced sequencing data for assembly of 30 samples. Multiple data types including PacBio HiFi, Nanopore, Hi-C, and Bionano are avaiable. Strand-seq is available for 7 samples. Data created and hosted by the HPRC is open and available for download in our S3 & GCP buckets. Select data is also uploaded to international nucleotide sequencing databases (SRA/ENA/DDBJ) under the HPRC Genome Sequencing BioProject (PRJNA701308).
For information about data reuse and publicating with HPRC data please see the HPRC's Data Use Protocol. Note that the HPRC Year 1 data is pending publication, currently scheduled for mid-2021. If you would like to publish using this please contact the HPRC Coordinating Center at hprcadmin@gowustl.onmicrosoft.com *
